# Global Participative Sculpture

## SUMMARY

Augmented reality provides visual artists with a universe without borders and limits. An expression of this fact is the virtual artwork "BiggAR" which occupies the skies all over the globe since 2010. Because a majority of people nowadays have access to the tools to view and to interact with virtual content in their surrounding, we can say that augmented reality has turned the whole world into an interactive environment. To express this in a visual artistic way, a Global Participative Sculpture will be launched across the surface of the whole earth. A multi-user interactive artwork that will react with digital animation when it senses the presence of people. It cannot be touched physically, but it can be 'touched' through GPS-presence. Virtual material will be an unignorable component of our future reality, and it provides our world with some new and amazingly unique features.
