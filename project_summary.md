# Global Participative Sculpture

## SUMMARY

Augmented reality provides visual artists with a universe without borders and limits. An expressive example of this fact was the launch of virtual artwork "BiggAR" (see below) which occupies the augmented skies all over the globe since 2010. Because nowadays a majority of people has access to the tools to view and to interact with virtual content in their surrounding, we can say that augmented reality has turned the whole world into an interactive environment. To express this in a visual artistic way, I'm launching a Global Participative Sculpture covering the surface of the whole earth. 

G.P.S is a virtual interactive artwork, but although it cannot be touched physically, that doesn't mean it's not real. It's having many of the features of tangible material, and even some qualities unique to the fact that it's an artwork created for a hybrid reality which is a blend of our physical world and an infinite digital universe. The sculpture covers locations in our physical world and it interacts with its environment and the environment interacts with the sculpture. The virtual sculpture has a memory that is keeping track of any interaction on any GPS location anywhere on the planet. The global artwork is a local experience at the same time, when you're exploring the interaction with other people in your surrounding.
