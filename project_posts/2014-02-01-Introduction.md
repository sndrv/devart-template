Ever since I the time I learned coding on a commodore 64 home computer, I've been creating visuals by programming. Somehow, nothing has changed. After getting a degree in computer science at the VU university in Amsterdam, I studied "instable media" at the Rietveld art academy. I still use my digital skills to program digital art, but these days, thanks to augmented reality technology I'm able to let my artworks appear in the physical world. I've been creating XXXL sized AR decors for theater groups, I've created hybrid fashion in cooperation with a fashion designer, mixing tangible and virtual reality.

My projects are often aimed at exploring the boundaries of new technology. I look at technological possibilities, but also to societal impacts and the consequences for the existing world of art. An example is the uninvited exhibited in the MoMA museum in New York together with fellow artists of the Manifest.AR artists collective, which I co-founded. My contribution to the show was an extension of the museum building with a virtual 7th floor.

The paralel digital world is without limits, when you're able to program it. Showcasing this fact was the background of my global artwork BiggAR.

Now it's time to implement an upgrade of the concept. I'm going to launch an interactive artwork that stretches out across the surface of the whole earth. Wherever you are, you will find yourself amidst a field of typical Google Map pins.

The pins are going to appear worldwide, hence the title of the project "Global Participative Sculpture"(GPS). By walking through this augmented field of pins, the pins will start spinning.
The interactive augmented reality artwork can be experienced as an intangible kinectic sculpture that will react with animation as a result of the presence of a (smartphone connected) human.
