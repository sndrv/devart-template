# STEP 1 & 2

An initial version 0.5 of the script has been implemented. The script is about 100 lines long. The JSON code it generates is much longer. Comments explain the purpose of the pieces of code. Most of it is in use to specify the POI (points of interest) according to the specs provided by Layar. See below:

The script is placed on a server that parses php. When pointed to this file, the Layar browser succesfully reads and parses the JSON. A grid of points appears surrounding the viewer!
