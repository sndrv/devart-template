# IT'S READY!

The Global Participative Sculpture is there! It's everywhere around the world, so give it a try! Install the Layar browser on your smartphone or tablet and open the geo-layer "G.P.S".

Creating outdoor augmented reality is a very physical way of software development. It's a different situation compared to the traditional desk based working space. During the past years I've opened my laptop on a huge variety of outdoor spots, under various weather conditions. Walking around to test GPS-positioned appearances, to finetune 3D tracking of buildings, and meanwhile debugging my scripts and trying to find out what's wrong looking around in augmented world that's completely empty. Because it's often a software only approach, there's no huge hardware department involved. Especially when a virtual work is placed at a location uninvitedly. Outdoor testing, debugging and finetuning a multi-user project like this, brings in the additional issues of working on a tethered wifi-connection and batteries of all the required devices that are always running low. The struggles of the connected human being anno now!

# OPTIMALISATION

The fastest refresh-rate of the current implementation in the Layar browser is 10 seconds. In the worst case, it takes 10 seconds until a fellow user of the layar is being detected and visualised through rotating pins at his or her GPS location in the distance. Obviously, the speed and accuracy is something that will need to be improved when creating a dedicated app based on this prototype.
