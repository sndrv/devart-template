# IT'S READY!

Creating augmented reality is a somehow unusual way of software development. It's a different situation compared to the traditional desk based working space. During the past years I've opened my laptop on a huge variety of outdoor spots, under various weather conditions. To test GPS-positioned appearances, to finetune 3D tracking of buildings, and meanwhile debugging my scripts and trying to find out what's wrong looking around in augmented world that's completely empty. Debugging a multi-user project like this, and documenting it brings in the additional issues of working on a tethered wifi-connection and batteries of all the required devices that are always running low. The struggles of the connected human being anno now!

But the Global Participative Sculpture is there! It's everywhere around the world, so give it a try! Install the Layar browser on your smartphone or tablet and open the geo-layer "G.P.S".

# OPTIMALISATION

The fastest refresh-rate of the current implementation in the Layar browser is 10 seconds. In the worst case, it takes 10 seconds until a fellow user of the layar is being detected and visualised through rotating pins at his or her GPS location in the distance. Obviously, the speed and accuracy is something that will need to be improved when creating a dedicated app based on this prototype.
